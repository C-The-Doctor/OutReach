#  Key Points
*  We Need Another DB to hold records for Group And Single SSO
  - Heres The Plan
   1. Have N number Of Rows 4 For Data Entry
   2. Have An Extra COlumn To Show Targ Type - Group / Single
   3. Join Other Operational Data To Form An Array And SHove It To DB For Both  Route


 #  Groupigns

  * Our Group Route DOesnt Return Relevant Groups Belonging TO A User .
   It ONly DOes WHen Theirs Only One ENtry In The Data Returned From Sql .
   This Problem Lies In Create_Link_DBContext
   WHere Pinpointing To Groups That A User Has Subscribed TO seems problematic



   # Conversations & Upload LInks

   * Retreiving Entries From DB With More Than One Parameter Specified In The Sql Statement Fails
   * We NEed This TO Rereive Conversations For Students Based On Their Course , Certification , Year



   # Activities

   * Retreiving Activities ALso Fails Which IS Crucial As Its Passed To The Dashboard Context
   * Method 1
          : We Get The Groups From The User , Retreive All Of Their Activities
          : Adjoin Into An Array Then Return THe Array

          -or-

          :We Can Retreive All Activities From The DB , then We Filter In The Front End
          :By -- Selecting All GroupIDs Assoc With An activity
          -- Skipping Those Whose Group ID Font Match The Search Query , E.g ['DNA_OO1' , 'DXB-2235']
